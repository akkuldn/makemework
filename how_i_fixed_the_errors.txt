error 1- 
The tempreature was not being read correctly.
I figured out as the error being displayed was that the temperature was not of integer data type.
I fixed it by changing the split subscript value in the main page.

Error 2-
It was a key error as there was a mismatch in the strings in the e2e_weather_shopper_conf.py and in the test_e2e_purchase.py.
I fixed it by changing the name in conf to the one given in the test_e2e_putchase.py file

Error 3-
The error was that,could not  obtain the cheapest product with filter condition .
It had occured as the min value was intioalized to 10000 and the if condition was checking for products greater than 10000
I cleared it by changing the '>=' condition to '<=' in product_object.py page

Error 4-
It was type error. As the operators did not support none type.
It had occured because the function did not return any value .
I fixed it by returning ' Empty_cart_flag' in 'get_current_cart_quantity' function in Product_object.py page 

Error 5-
The error was that ,it was unbale to locate and click on the cart button.
I fixed the error by changing the xpath of cart button in locators_conf.py file

Error 6-
The error was that, it was that there was no attribute verify cart in mainpage.
I fixed it by changing the word 'main'  to'carts' was defined in the Page_object.py file
