error 1- 
The tempreature was not being read correctly.
I figured out as the error being displayed was that the temperature was not of integer data type.
I fixed it by changing the split subscript value in the main page.

Error 2-
It was a key error as there was a mismatch in the strings in the e2e_weather_shopper_conf.py and in the test_e2e_purchase.py.
I fixed it by changing the name in conf to the one given in the test_e2e_putchase.py file

Error 3-
The error was that,could not  obtain the cheapest product with filter condition .
It had occured as the min value was intioalized to 10000 and the if condition was checking for products greater than 10000
I cleared it by changing the '>=' condition to '<=' in product_object.py page

Error 4-
It was type error. As the operators did not support none type.
It had occured because the function did not return any value .
I fixed it by returning ' Empty_cart_flag' in 'get_current_cart_quantity' function in Product_object.py page 

Error 5-
The error was that ,it was unbale to locate and click on the cart button.
I fixed the error by changing the xpath of cart button in locators_conf.py file

Error 6-
The error was that, it was that there was no attribute verify cart in mainpage.
I fixed it by changing the word 'main'  to'carts' was defined in the Page_object.py file

Error 7-
The hardest error till now. It was list index out of bounds error.
Only one element was getting pushed to the list items in cart page.
I figured it out by giving repeated print statements to follow the flow of the program and finally arrived at the location of the error
I fixed it by moving the appending fuction inside for loop in the get_cart_items method

Error 8-
Error was that something went wrong with the cart and the actual total and the expected total didnt match.
The first easy visible fix was to change the print statement after checking the result flag,as both positive and negtive conditions had the same print statement.
The next step was fixing the total that was being calculated. The expected total was giving out the price of just the second item
I fixed it by changing the 'expected_total=product.price' to 'expected_total=expected_total+product.price' in the verify_cart_total function of cart_page
The final fix was changing the item_match_flag in verify_extra_item to true.

Error 9-

Error was that there is no attribute past_counter in cart_page. It was because the an attribute past_counter was referenced at the test_e2e_purchase page. 
The error was fixed by changing 'past_counter' to 'pass_counter'
